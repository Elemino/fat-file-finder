# FatFileFinder

Experimental [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app which helps to find large files recursively on your filesystm. Build with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) in ES6.



For performance reasons FatFileFinder currently ignores files smaller than 1 MB (shouldn't matter if you are searching for the big boys).
